          {'\n'}
          I. The Burial of the Dead {'\n'}
          {'\n'}
          April is the cruellest month, breeding {'\n'}
          Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing {'\n'}
          Memory and desire, stirring {'\n'}
          Dull roots with spring rain. {'\n'}
          Winter kept us warm, covering {'\n'}
          Earth in forgetful snow, feeding {'\n'}
          A little life with dried tubers. {'\n'}
          Summer surprised us, coming over the Starnbergersee {'\n'}
          With a shower of rain; we stopped in the colonnade, {'\n'}
          And went on in sunlight, into the Hofgarten, {'\n'}
          And drank coffee, and talked for an hour. {'\n'}
          Bin gar keine Russin, stamm’ aus Litauen, echt deutsch. {'\n'}
          And when we were children, staying at the archduke’s, {'\n'}
          My cousin’s, he took me out on a sled, {'\n'}
          And I was frightened. He said, Marie, {'\n'}
          Marie, hold on tight. And down we went. {'\n'}
          In the mountains, there you feel free. {'\n'}
          I read, much of the night, and go south in the winter. {'\n'}

          What are the roots that clutch, what branches grow {'\n'}
          Out of this stony rubbish? Son of man, {'\n'}
          You cannot say, or guess, for you know only {'\n'}
          A heap of broken images, where the sun beats, {'\n'}
          And the dead tree gives no shelter, the cricket no relief, {'\n'}
          And the dry stone no sound of water. Only {'\n'}
          There is shadow under this red rock, {'\n'}
          (Come in under the shadow of this red rock), {'\n'}
          And I will show you something different from either {'\n'}
          Your shadow at morning striding behind you {'\n'}
          Or your shadow at evening rising to meet you; {'\n'}
          I will show you fear in a handful of dust. {'\n'}
                                Frisch weht der Wind {'\n'}
                                Der Heimat zu {'\n'}
                                Mein Irisch Kind, {'\n'}
                                Wo weilest du? {'\n'}
          ‘You gave me hyacinths first a year ago; {'\n'}
          ‘They called me the hyacinth girl.’ {'\n'}
          —Yet when we came back, late, from the Hyacinth garden, {'\n'}
          Your arms full, and your hair wet, I could not {'\n'}
          Speak, and my eyes failed, I was neither {'\n'}
          Living nor dead, and I knew nothing, {'\n'}
          Looking into the heart of light, the silence. {'\n'}
          Oed’ und leer das Meer. {'\n'}

          Madame Sosostris, famous clairvoyante, {'\n'}
          Had a bad cold, nevertheless {'\n'}
          Is known to be the wisest woman in Europe, {'\n'}
          With a wicked pack of cards. Here, said she, {'\n'}
          Is your card, the drowned Phoenician Sailor, {'\n'}
          (Those are pearls that were his eyes. Look!) {'\n'}
          Here is Belladonna, the Lady of the Rocks, {'\n'}
          The lady of situations. {'\n'}
          Here is the man with three staves, and here the Wheel, {'\n'}
          And here is the one-eyed merchant, and this card, {'\n'}
          Which is blank, is something he carries on his back, {'\n'}
          Which I am forbidden to see. I do not find {'\n'}
          The Hanged Man. Fear death by water. {'\n'}
          I see crowds of people, walking round in a ring. {'\n'}
          Thank you. If you see dear Mrs. Equitone, {'\n'}
          Tell her I bring the horoscope myself: {'\n'}
          One must be so careful these days. {'\n'}

          Unreal City, {'\n'}
          Under the brown fog of a winter dawn, {'\n'}
          A crowd flowed over London Bridge, so many, {'\n'}
          I had not thought death had undone so many. {'\n'}
          Sighs, short and infrequent, were exhaled, {'\n'}
          And each man fixed his eyes before his feet. {'\n'}
          Flowed up the hill and down King William Street, {'\n'}
          To where Saint Mary Woolnoth kept the hours {'\n'}
          With a dead sound on the final stroke of nine. {'\n'}
          There I saw one I knew, and stopped him, crying: 'Stetson! {'\n'}
          ‘You who were with me in the ships at Mylae! {'\n'}
          ‘That corpse you planted last year in your garden, {'\n'}
          ‘Has it begun to sprout? Will it bloom this year? {'\n'}
          ‘Or has the sudden frost disturbed its bed? {'\n'}
          ‘Oh keep the Dog far hence, that’s friend to men, {'\n'}
          ‘Or with his nails he’ll dig it up again! {'\n'}
          ‘You! hypocrite lecteur!—mon semblable,—mon frère!” {'\n'}

                        II. A Game of Chess

          The Chair she sat in, like a burnished throne, {'\n'}
          Glowed on the marble, where the glass {'\n'}
          Held up by standards wrought with fruited vines {'\n'}
          From which a golden Cupidon peeped out {'\n'}
          (Another hid his eyes behind his wing) {'\n'}
          Doubled the flames of sevenbranched candelabra {'\n'}
          Reflecting light upon the table as {'\n'}
          The glitter of her jewels rose to meet it, {'\n'}
          From satin cases poured in rich profusion; {'\n'}
          In vials of ivory and coloured glass {'\n'}
          Unstoppered, lurked her strange synthetic perfumes, {'\n'}
          Unguent, powdered, or liquid—troubled, confused {'\n'}
          And drowned the sense in odours; stirred by the air {'\n'}
          That freshened from the window, these ascended {'\n'}
          In fattening the prolonged candle-flames, {'\n'}
          Flung their smoke into the laquearia, {'\n'}
          Stirring the pattern on the coffered ceiling. {'\n'}
          Huge sea-wood fed with copper {'\n'}
          Burned green and orange, framed by the coloured stone, {'\n'}
          In which sad light a carvéd dolphin swam. {'\n'}
          Above the antique mantel was displayed {'\n'}
          As though a window gave upon the sylvan scene {'\n'}
          The change of Philomel, by the barbarous king {'\n'}
          So rudely forced; yet there the nightingale {'\n'}
          Filled all the desert with inviolable voice {'\n'}
          And still she cried, and still the world pursues, {'\n'}
          ‘Jug Jug’ to dirty ears. {'\n'}
          And other withered stumps of time {'\n'}
          Were told upon the walls; staring forms {'\n'}
          Leaned out, leaning, hushing the room enclosed. {'\n'}
          Footsteps shuffled on the stair. {'\n'}
          Under the firelight, under the brush, her hair {'\n'}
          Spread out in fiery points {'\n'}
          Glowed into words, then would be savagely still. {'\n'}
          ‘My nerves are bad tonight. Yes, bad. Stay with me. {'\n'}
          Speak to me. Why do you never speak. Speak. {'\n'}
          What are you thinking of? What thinking? What? {'\n'}
          I never know what you are thinking. Think.’ {'\n'}
          I think we are in rats’ alley {'\n'}
          Where the dead men lost their bones. {'\n'}
          ‘What is that noise?’ {'\n'}
                                    The wind under the door. {'\n'}
          ‘What is that noise now? What is the wind doing?’ {'\n'}
                                    Nothing again nothing. {'\n'}
                                                                  ‘Do {'\n'}
          ‘You know nothing? Do you see nothing? Do you remember {'\n'}
          ‘Nothing?’ {'\n'}
                I remember {'\n'}
          Those are pearls that were his eyes. {'\n'}
          ‘Are you alive, or not? Is there nothing in your head?’ {'\n'}
                                                                                    But {'\n'}
          O O O O that Shakespeherian Rag— {'\n'}
          It’s so elegant {'\n'}
          So intelligent {'\n'}
          ‘What shall I do now? What shall I do?’ {'\n'}
          ‘I shall rush out as I am, and walk the street {'\n'}
          ‘With my hair down, so. What shall we do tomorrow? {'\n'}
          ‘What shall we ever do?’ {'\n'}
                                                        The hot water at ten. {'\n'}
          And if it rains, a closed car at four. {'\n'}
          And we shall play a game of chess, {'\n'}
          Pressing lidless eyes and waiting for a knock upon the door. {'\n'}
          When Lil’s husband got demobbed, I said— {'\n'}
          I didn’t mince my words, I said to her myself, {'\n'}
          HURRY UP PLEASE ITS TIME {'\n'}
          Now Albert’s coming back, make yourself a bit smart. {'\n'}
          He’ll want to know what you done with that money he gave you {'\n'}
          To get yourself some teeth. He did, I was there. {'\n'}
          You have them all out, Lil, and get a nice set, {'\n'}
          He said, I swear, I can’t bear to look at you. {'\n'}
          And no more can’t I, I said, and think of poor Albert, {'\n'}
          He’s been in the army four years, he wants a good time, {'\n'}
          And if you don’t give it him, there’s others will, I said. {'\n'}
          Oh is there, she said. Something o’ that, I said. {'\n'}
          Then I’ll know who to thank, she said, and give me a straight look. {'\n'}
          HURRY UP PLEASE ITS TIME {'\n'}
          If you don’t like it you can get on with it, I said. {'\n'}
          Others can pick and choose if you can’t. {'\n'}
          But if Albert makes off, it won’t be for lack of telling. {'\n'}
          You ought to be ashamed, I said, to look so antique. {'\n'}
          (And her only thirty-one.) {'\n'}
          I can’t help it, she said, pulling a long face, {'\n'}
          It’s them pills I took, to bring it off, she said. {'\n'}
          (She’s had five already, and nearly died of young George.) {'\n'}
          The chemist said it would be all right, but I’ve never been the same. {'\n'}
          You are a proper fool, I said. {'\n'}
          Well, if Albert won’t leave you alone, there it is, I said, {'\n'}
          What you get married for if you don’t want children? {'\n'}
          HURRY UP PLEASE ITS TIME {'\n'}
          Well, that Sunday Albert was home, they had a hot gammon, {'\n'}
          And they asked me in to dinner, to get the beauty of it hot— {'\n'}
          HURRY UP PLEASE ITS TIME {'\n'}
          HURRY UP PLEASE ITS TIME {'\n'}
          Goonight Bill. Goonight Lou. Goonight May. Goonight. {'\n'}
          Ta ta. Goonight. Goonight. {'\n'}
          Good night, ladies, good night, sweet ladies, good night, good night. {'\n'}

                        III. The Fire Sermon

          The river’s tent is broken: the last fingers of leaf {'\n'}
          Clutch and sink into the wet bank. The wind {'\n'}
          Crosses the brown land, unheard. The nymphs are departed. {'\n'}
          Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song. {'\n'}
          The river bears no empty bottles, sandwich papers, {'\n'}
          Silk handkerchiefs, cardboard boxes, cigarette ends {'\n'}
          Or other testimony of summer nights. The nymphs are departed. {'\n'}
          And their friends, the loitering heirs of City directors; {'\n'}
          Departed, have left no addresses. {'\n'}
          By the waters of Leman I sat down and wept . . . {'\n'}
          Sweet Thames, run softly till I end my song, {'\n'}
          Sweet Thames, run softly, for I speak not loud or long. {'\n'}
          But at my back in a cold blast I hear {'\n'}
          The rattle of the bones, and chuckle spread from ear to ear. {'\n'}
          A rat crept softly through the vegetation {'\n'}
          Dragging its slimy belly on the bank {'\n'}
          While I was fishing in the dull canal {'\n'}
          On a winter evening round behind the gashouse {'\n'}
          Musing upon the king my brother’s wreck {'\n'}
          And on the king my father’s death before him. {'\n'}
          White bodies naked on the low damp ground {'\n'}
          And bones cast in a little low dry garret, {'\n'}
          Rattled by the rat’s foot only, year to year. {'\n'}
          But at my back from time to time I hear {'\n'}
          The sound of horns and motors, which shall bring {'\n'}
          Sweeney to Mrs. Porter in the spring. {'\n'}
          O the moon shone bright on Mrs. Porter {'\n'}
          And on her daughter {'\n'}
          They wash their feet in soda water {'\n'}
          Et O ces voix d’enfants, chantant dans la coupole! {'\n'}
          Twit twit twit {'\n'}
          Jug jug jug jug jug jug {'\n'}
          So rudely forc’d. {'\n'}
          Tereu {'\n'}
          Unreal City {'\n'}
          Under the brown fog of a winter noon {'\n'}
          Mr. Eugenides, the Smyrna merchant {'\n'}
          Unshaven, with a pocket full of currants {'\n'}
          C.i.f. London: documents at sight, {'\n'}
          Asked me in demotic French {'\n'}
          To luncheon at the Cannon Street Hotel {'\n'}
          Followed by a weekend at the Metropole. {'\n'}
          At the violet hour, when the eyes and back {'\n'}
          Turn upward from the desk, when the human engine waits {'\n'}
          Like a taxi throbbing waiting, {'\n'}
          I Tiresias, though blind, throbbing between two lives, {'\n'}
          Old man with wrinkled female breasts, can see {'\n'}
          At the violet hour, the evening hour that strives {'\n'}
          Homeward, and brings the sailor home from sea, {'\n'}
          The typist home at teatime, clears her breakfast, lights {'\n'}
          Her stove, and lays out food in tins. {'\n'}
          Out of the window perilously spread {'\n'}
          Her drying combinations touched by the sun’s last rays, {'\n'}
          On the divan are piled (at night her bed) {'\n'}
          Stockings, slippers, camisoles, and stays. {'\n'}
          I Tiresias, old man with wrinkled dugs {'\n'}
          Perceived the scene, and foretold the rest— {'\n'}
          I too awaited the expected guest. {'\n'}
          He, the young man carbuncular, arrives, {'\n'}
          A small house agent’s clerk, with one bold stare, {'\n'}
          One of the low on whom assurance sits {'\n'}
          As a silk hat on a Bradford millionaire. {'\n'}
          The time is now propitious, as he guesses, {'\n'}
          The meal is ended, she is bored and tired, {'\n'}
          Endeavours to engage her in caresses {'\n'}
          Which still are unreproved, if undesired. {'\n'}
          Flushed and decided, he assaults at once; {'\n'}
          Exploring hands encounter no defence; {'\n'}
          His vanity requires no response, {'\n'}
          And makes a welcome of indifference. {'\n'}
          (And I Tiresias have foresuffered all {'\n'}
          Enacted on this same divan or bed; {'\n'}
          I who have sat by Thebes below the wall {'\n'}
          And walked among the lowest of the dead.) {'\n'}
          Bestows one final patronising kiss, {'\n'}
          And gropes his way, finding the stairs unlit . . . {'\n'}
          She turns and looks a moment in the glass, {'\n'}
          Hardly aware of her departed lover; {'\n'}
          Her brain allows one half-formed thought to pass: {'\n'}
          'Well now that’s done: and I’m glad it’s over.’ {'\n'}
          When lovely woman stoops to folly and {'\n'}
          Paces about her room again, alone, {'\n'}
          She smooths her hair with automatic hand, {'\n'}
          And puts a record on the gramophone. {'\n'}

                        IV. Death by Water

          Phlebas the Phoenician, a fortnight dead, {'\n'}
          Forgot the cry of gulls, and the deep sea swell {'\n'}
          And the profit and loss. {'\n'}
                                            A current under sea {'\n'}
          Picked his bones in whispers. As he rose and fell {'\n'}
          He passed the stages of his age and youth {'\n'}
          Entering the whirlpool. {'\n'}
                                            Gentile or Jew {'\n'}
          O you who turn the wheel and look to windward, {'\n'}
          Consider Phlebas, who was once handsome and tall as you. {'\n'}

                        V. What the Thunder Said

          After the torchlight red on sweaty faces {'\n'}
          After the frosty silence in the gardens {'\n'}
          After the agony in stony places {'\n'}
          The shouting and the crying {'\n'}
          Prison and palace and reverberation {'\n'}
          Of thunder of spring over distant mountains {'\n'}
          He who was living is now dead {'\n'}
          We who were living are now dying {'\n'}
          With a little patience {'\n'}
          Here is no water but only rock {'\n'}
          Rock and no water and the sandy road {'\n'}
          The road winding above among the mountains {'\n'}
          Which are mountains of rock without water {'\n'}
          If there were water we should stop and drink {'\n'}
          Amongst the rock one cannot stop or think {'\n'}
          Sweat is dry and feet are in the sand {'\n'}
          If there were only water amongst the rock {'\n'}
          Dead mountain mouth of carious teeth that cannot spit {'\n'}
          Here one can neither stand nor lie nor sit {'\n'}
          There is not even silence in the mountains {'\n'}
          But dry sterile thunder without rain {'\n'}
          There is not even solitude in the mountains {'\n'}
          But red sullen faces sneer and snarl {'\n'}
          From doors of mudcracked houses {'\n'}
                                                If there were water {'\n'}
            And no rock {'\n'}
            If there were rock {'\n'}
            And also water {'\n'}
            And water {'\n'}
            A spring {'\n'}
            A pool among the rock {'\n'}
            If there were the sound of water only {'\n'}
            Not the cicada {'\n'}
            And dry grass singing {'\n'}
            But sound of water over a rock {'\n'}
            Where the hermit-thrush sings in the pine trees {'\n'}
            Drip drop drip drop drop drop drop {'\n'}
            But there is no water {'\n'}
          Who is the third who walks always beside you? {'\n'}
          When I count, there are only you and I together {'\n'}
          But when I look ahead up the white road {'\n'}
          There is always another one walking beside you {'\n'}
          Gliding wrapt in a brown mantle, hooded {'\n'}
          I do not know whether a man or a woman {'\n'}
          —But who is that on the other side of you? {'\n'}
          What is that sound high in the air {'\n'}
          Murmur of maternal lamentation {'\n'}
          Who are those hooded hordes swarming {'\n'}
          Over endless plains, stumbling in cracked earth {'\n'}
          Ringed by the flat horizon only {'\n'}
          What is the city over the mountains {'\n'}
          Cracks and reforms and bursts in the violet air {'\n'}
          Falling towers {'\n'}
          Jerusalem Athens Alexandria {'\n'}
          Vienna London {'\n'}
          Unreal {'\n'}
          A woman drew her long black hair out tight {'\n'}
          And fiddled whisper music on those strings {'\n'}
          And bats with baby faces in the violet light {'\n'}
          Whistled, and beat their wings {'\n'}
          And crawled head downward down a blackened wall {'\n'}
          And upside down in air were towers {'\n'}
          Tolling reminiscent bells, that kept the hours {'\n'}
          And voices singing out of empty cisterns and exhausted wells. {'\n'}
          In this decayed hole among the mountains {'\n'}
          In the faint moonlight, the grass is singing {'\n'}
          Over the tumbled graves, about the chapel {'\n'}
          There is the empty chapel, only the wind’s home. {'\n'}
          It has no windows, and the door swings, {'\n'}
          Dry bones can harm no one. {'\n'}
          Only a cock stood on the rooftree {'\n'}
          Co co rico co co rico {'\n'}
          In a flash of lightning. Then a damp gust {'\n'}
          Bringing rain {'\n'}
          Ganga was sunken, and the limp leaves {'\n'}
          Waited for rain, while the black clouds {'\n'}
          Gathered far distant, over Himavant. {'\n'}
          The jungle crouched, humped in silence. {'\n'}
          Then spoke the thunder {'\n'}
          DA {'\n'}
          Datta: what have we given? {'\n'}
          My friend, blood shaking my heart {'\n'}
          The awful daring of a moment’s surrender {'\n'}
          Which an age of prudence can never retract {'\n'}
          By this, and this only, we have existed {'\n'}
          Which is not to be found in our obituaries {'\n'}
          Or in memories draped by the beneficent spider {'\n'}
          Or under seals broken by the lean solicitor {'\n'}
          In our empty rooms {'\n'}
          DA {'\n'}
          Dayadhvam: I have heard the key {'\n'}
          Turn in the door once and turn once only {'\n'}
          We think of the key, each in his prison {'\n'}
          Thinking of the key, each confirms a prison {'\n'}
          Only at nightfall, aethereal rumours {'\n'}
          Revive for a moment a broken Coriolanus {'\n'}
          DA {'\n'}
          Damyata: The boat responded {'\n'}
          Gaily, to the hand expert with sail and oar {'\n'}
          The sea was calm, your heart would have responded {'\n'}
          Gaily, when invited, beating obedient {'\n'}
          To controlling hands {'\n'}
                                              I sat upon the shore {'\n'}
          Fishing, with the arid plain behind me {'\n'}
          Shall I at least set my lands in order? {'\n'}
          London Bridge is falling down falling down falling down {'\n'}
          Poi s’ascose nel foco che gli affina {'\n'}
          Quando fiam uti chelidon—O swallow swallow {'\n'}
          Le Prince d’Aquitaine à la tour abolie {'\n'}
          These fragments I have shored against my ruins {'\n'}
          Why then Ile fit you. Hieronymo’s mad againe. {'\n'}
          Datta. Dayadhvam. Damyata. {'\n'}
                            Shantih     shantih     shantih  {'\n'}
